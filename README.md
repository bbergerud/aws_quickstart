# AWS Playground

Just a repo for building bash scripts for Amazon Web Services (AWS)

## Usage

You'll want to download the Amazon [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

To run the bash scripts in the [src](./src) directory, you'll likely need to give them permission using chmod, e.g.
```
> chmod 755 src/s3.sh
```
